Church Growth

*Added to Day One March 8, 2014*

My wife and I have been in the process of trying to find a new church family. Perhaps it is a flaw, but I find myself instantly wary of large churches.

The reason is that I know:


a) There are bad churches[^fn1]
b) People are inherently sinful[^fn2]
c) Some of those people, deceive themselves into thinking they have a relationship with Christ when they really don't[^fn3]

And so, there are churches which attract these false believers by the hundreds and thousands with their soft stance on multiple points of doctrine which are central to the Christian faith.[^fn4]

However, trying to be a sensitive leader to my wife, I try to take her wants and desires into account when looking for a church. One of the things that my wife wants out of the church that we choose is visible church growth. I agree that the growth of the church is very important. In fact, I think a church (much like the Christians which inhabit it's pews) is either growing,...or dying.

But, where most people would speak about church growth in a physical sense, meaning bringing more and more members in off the street, I tend to think about church growth in more broad terms. The building is not the church. Christ's Church is the congregation of believers. I think the most important aspect of church growth is the continual spiritual growth of the members of the church. They should day-by-day become more conformed to the image of their Creator. This stands true for a church of 5,000 or a church of 3.

[^fn1]: (Revelation 2:1-6)(Revelation 3:3-4)

[^fn2]: (Romans 3:23)(Psalm 51:5)

[^fn3]: (Matthew 7:21-23)

[^fn4]: (2 Timothy 4:3)

**Couple of editorial notes** about this journal entry, I got the idea to go back and enter these blog posts this morning (March 7, 2014) while laying in bed. It seemed fitting, though there was not much content, to begin with my first ever blog post. I went back in the Day One calendar and added it on the date that it was originally written. (August 11, 2010) I will be adding other entries as time goes on in the same manner. Posted on the date that they were originally written, but marked with the date that they were actually added to the day one journal. I should also note, all metadata such as location, time, etc. is metadata from the time of entry into Day One not the original writing.
