Benevolent Societies — St. John's German Lu- 



theran Orphan Asylum, situated in East Toledo, a 
short distance South of the River, was founded in 
1860. The Trustees in 1870 were Revs. John Dein- 
doerfer, C. E. Bode and Charles Beckel ; and H. H. 
Sampson, Jac. Nesper and John Bittel. It is sup- 
ported by the Lutheran Church and voluntary con- 
tributions, and in 1887 was under the charge of Rev. 
Beckel. 

The Societies for tne care of the sick, the burial 
of the dead, and relief of members in adversity, 
have augmented since 1854, when the first Firemen's 
Benevolent Society was inaugurated, to quite a form- 
idable array ; so that we can name but those which 
now afford proof that the inclination to afford mutual 
relief and assistance has not declined by the increase 
of population. One of the oldest of these organiza- 
tions is the Deutscher Arbeiter (Laborers) Unter- 
stuetzungs Verein, founded in 1868, numbering at 
present 141 members, and estimating their assets at 
54,300. Their first President was George Gerber, 
with Franz Tillman and Jos. Meyer as Vice Presi- 
dents. Officers at present — John Henry, Aug. 
Schwarz, H. Neumeyer. The Toledo Kranken (Sick) 
LTnterstuetzungs Verein, constituted in 1870 (when 
George Meissner and C. Hipp were the first and 
second Presidents), counted in 1885, 137 members, 
with resources valued at SI. 700. Officers — Hy. 
Stock, President; C. W^eil and Herm. Rausch, Vice 
Presidents ; Jos. Livers, Treasurer. Beside these, we 
have the Badische Unterstuetzungs Verein — Presi- 
dent, .lac. Hoffman ; the German Laborers' Benefi- 
cial, President, F. Wagenknecht ; the German Pro- 
tective Association, President, Jac. Hermann ; the 
Gruetli Verein, President, F. Zumbrun ; the Hildise 
Bund, President, N. Mertes ; the Keduscha Society, 
of which N. D. Oesterman is President ; the Fritz 
Renter, F. C. C. Mau, President ; the Schwaebische 
(Suabian) Unterstuetzungs Verein, President, John
