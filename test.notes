Massachusetts and other states elected special conventions to draft constitutions and then held special elections to ratify them to underscore the supremacy and the republican character of constitutional provisions. These solemn, deliberate acts of the people established a “higher law” that a majority of the legislature or even of the people would be forbidden to violate.

that certain rights were “unalienable,” and in another that “Governments…derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.” Rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were not to be submitted to a vote or to depend on the outcome of elections; that is, not even the consent of the governed could legitimately abridge them.

both sides in the ratification struggle, sought to fulfill the purposes of the Declaration of Independence to both protect rights and insure government by consent.

Equally discredited was “mere democracy” which still meant, as Aristotle had taught, rule by the passionate, ignorant, demagogue-dominated “voice of the people.”

This was sure to produce first injustice, then anarchy, and finally tyranny. Hence, virtually all shades of opinion reviled monarchy and democracy, and, publicly at least, affirmed republicanism.

Could mere complication of government, together with devices to “refine” the expression of majority will, without departing fundamentally from the principle of consent, protect basic rights both from potential tyrants within government and from popular passions?

The anti-federalists looked to the Classical idealization of the small, pastoral republic where virtuous, self-reliant citizens managed their own affairs and shunned the power and glory of empire.

*****

The anti-federalists were, in a sense, “men of little faith” as both contemporary and modern critics have charged, but this was true only within their fear that centralized power tended to become arbitrary and impersonal. The anti-federalists came to these views more readily, of course, because the Whig rhetoric of eighteenth-century British radicalism and the ideology of the American Revolution were filled with suspicions of power, especially distant, centralized power. These arguments were now handy for use against other advocates of such power.

*****

To the anti-federalists this meant retaining as much as possible the vitality of local government where rulers and ruled could see, know, and understand each other.

Each “district,” furthermore, would be a town or ward or region conscious of its own particular identity rather than being some amorphous, arbitrary geographic entity

who lived in a distant capital milieu where power, intrigue, and wealth exerted their baneful influence.

*****

If the basic decency in human nature, most evident among ordinary people at the local level amid family, church, school, and other nourishing institutions, could impinge directly and continuously on government, then perhaps it too might be kept virtuous and worthy of confidence.

*****

The wealthy and the powerful, sad to say, were inclined to cheat customers, disdain honest labor, raise armies, put on social airs, and oppress the people. Could they be expected to rule wisely and justly in the interests of all? Rather, it was necessary that people of the “middling sort,” average people, perhaps yeoman farmers, themselves take part in government—even be elected to office in large enough numbers to “set the tone” in the capital. Such people, in the daily round of their occupations, Smith observed, had “less temptations, [and] are inclined by habit, and by the company with whom they associate, to set bounds to their passions and appetites.”

*****

The result was an increasing corruption and degeneracy in both rulers and ruled.

*****

The great desideratum which has not yet been found for Republican Governments seems to be some disinterested and dispassionate umpire in disputes between different passions and interests in the State.

--
Mr Wilson Debate of the New Jersey Plan (June 16)

We are very concerned with checks even within single branches of government. This is because of the gulf between aristocracy and the "common man," which we don't talk much about in such terms anymore. Today, we allude to the same issue with terms such as "elites," but I think we do damage to the concept with such terms. The term has been overloaded with the stench of (at best) hare-brained conspiracy theories, or (at worst) racial undertones of a most unsavory kind. However, we do, in fact, have to account for an _American aristocracy_ which consists of celebrity, financiers, and businesses that conceal their monopoly through the multiplicity of ownership, or through their cooperation with government interests. This aristocracy has made its influence felt in both houses of the Legislature.

He could not persuade himself that the State Governments and Sovereignties were so much the idols of the people, nor a National Government so obnoxious to them, as some supposed. Why should a National Government be unpopular? Has it less dignity? Will each Citizen enjoy under it less liberty or protection? Will a Citizen of Delaware be degraded by becoming a Citizen of the United States? Where do the people look at present for relief from the evils of which they complain? Is it from an internal reform of their Governments? No, Sir. It is from the National Councils that relief is expected. For these reasons he did not fear, that the people would not follow us into a national Government and it will be a further recommendation of Mr. Randolph’s plan that it is to be submitted to them, and not to the Legislatures, for ratification.
