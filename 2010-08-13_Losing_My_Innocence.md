Losing My Innocence

*Added to Day One April 3, 2014*

Growing up, like most only children, I had an especially active imagination. I think this plays a key role in my interest in creating and telling stories of all kinds.

Anyway, as a child I was always creating elaborate worlds. And, as I would pretend to inhabit these worlds, it would always involve me being the hero. I don’t think this is very uncommon. Everyone wants to be the hero in their own story. However, as I grew up, and got involved in things that I shouldn’t have, I slowly began to realize the dissonance between my view of myself as hero, and the reality of who I was.

According to the Bible, we are all dead in sin, and powerless to do good and please God. [^fn1]  This doesn’t, I think, preclude people’s desire to “be good”. When sharing the Gospel, this is often times a sticking point for most listeners. I point out what The Bible says about the inability of men to please God in their natural state, and it never fails that the listener will point out all of the good things that unsaved people do on a regular basis. Such-and-such gave this much money to charity, and so-and-so helps feed the homeless, or care for the elderly. The List goes on and on.

[^fn1]:(Romans 3:10)(Romans 3:23)

But, what God is talking about excludes all of those things. You mean God looks at all of those things that people do that are good, and they aren’t good enough for him? Yep. That’s exactly what I mean. [^fn2] incidentally, the hebrew phrase here for polluted garment is the same as saying “menstrual rags.” So these good works aren’t simply being compared to the oily rags you have scattered in your garage. The phrase carries with it the idea of unhealthiness, and infection.

[^fn2]:(Isaiah 64:6)

God is not interested in goodness for goodness sake, nor, even worse, is he interested in goodness to feed our over-grown egos and give us a sense of entitlement of future rewards. God is only interested in good works as acts of obedience to him for redeeming you. [^fn3]

[^fn3]:(Ephesians 2:10)(James 1:27)

You see, without faith, it is impossible to please God. [^fn4] Faith? What kind of faith? Faith in God as the only grounds by which you will be counted righteous.

[^fn4]:(Hebrews 11:6)

Those who are not Christians do good things all the time. Those things, however, avail them nothing. Jesus did not die on the cross to make bad people good. He died on the cross to make dead people live.

Living your life, and acting a certain way, because you want to be the hero of your own story, is very different that actually being the hero.
